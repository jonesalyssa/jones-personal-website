    I created this webpage to be an interactive resource for viewers to learn stories about the abuse of the Endangered Species Act. You will find an interactive section to learn about several examples of false recoveries as well as find links to new articles discussing the report produced by my organization.
            
    <P>The use of user interaction strategies makes it fun to navigate through a rather daunting and complex public policy issue.
    </P>
        </p>
    <p> I've added quotes from Rep. Dan Newhouse (WA-04) and Senator Cynthia Lummis (WY) as well as the author of the report and the Executive Director of my organization to further valdiate the influence of the report.</p>

        I created this webpage to be a hub for all of the Western Caucus Foundation's digital materials. 
    </p>
    <p>
        You will find all of our weekly newslettrs, press releases, featured YouTube videos, and even social media posts through this, creating an end product that is easy for users to navigate. 
    </p>
    <p> My top priority for this project was ensuring the user has a good experience, so I leaned into my knowledge of UX in the process of producing this webpage.</p>
